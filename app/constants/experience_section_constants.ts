const thomsonReutersJobResponsibilities = [
  "At Thomson Reuters, I work on highly interactive and data-intensive web applications where performance and reliability directly shape user workflows. Most of my contributions revolve around identifying bottlenecks, simplifying complex UI logic, and improving the way data moves through the system.",
  "A significant part of my role involves breaking down slow or fragile areas of the application and redesigning them using a more predictable and scalable architecture. Whether it's optimizing render paths, reducing unnecessary re-computation, improving the batching of network calls, or tightening up the pipeline for deployments, I try to approach problems with long-term durability in mind.",
  "I frequently collaborate with backend teams to refine API contracts, reduce payload sizes, and design flows that avoid redundant calls under heavy usage. I also work closely with QA and product partners to ensure we ship features that are both user-focused and operationally stable.",
  "My day-to-day work sits at the intersection of frontend engineering, performance tuning, platform reliability, and CI/CD ecosystems giving me a broad view of how the entire system behaves in production.",
];

const cognizantJobResponsibilities = [
  "My time at Cognizant gave me hands-on experience with large and long-running enterprise applications, where engineering decisions accumulate over time. A lot of my work involved making existing systems easier to reason about: modularizing legacy UI, improving predictability in state management, and restructuring components to reduce cognitive load for future developers.",
  "I worked across features that dealt with search, filtering, and data visualization — areas that exposed me to latency, network constraints, and client-side performance challenges. I learned to think about how each part of the request/response chain affects the end user and how small architectural improvements can have outsized impact.",
  "This role also strengthened my skills in cross-team collaboration. I regularly aligned on requirements with product managers, validated technical feasibility with backend teams, and worked with QA engineers to ensure accessibility and compatibility across diverse environments.",
  "It was an environment where engineering quality mattered, and I learned how to balance scope, clarity, and timelines effectively.",
];

const internshipResponsibilities = [
  "I joined Cognizant as an intern after graduating in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. Despite coming from a non-CS background, I gravitated toward software early on and used this internship to build a formal foundation in development practices.",
  "During my training, I worked on internal projects using ASP.NET MVC and backend fundamentals. This experience helped me understand the structure behind production-grade systems, routing, server-side logic, data flow, and separation of concerns.",
  "It also taught me the importance of disciplined engineering: writing predictable code, following conventions, and understanding the “why” behind patterns.",
  "This internship laid the groundwork for my transition into a full‑time engineering role and eventually into the broader web ecosystem where I now operate.",
